# EnvisEdge Documentation and Relevant Content - NimbleEdge

## About NimbleEdge


NimbleEdge is leading the movement towards edge computing, building a new era of technology that alters the status quo between the cloud and the users' devices. NimbleEdge provides hyper-personalised AI without any data leaving the device. A technology that is inherently privacy-preserving.


Our core mission is to educate and raise awareness of edge computing and the benefits of the edge in terms of privacy, security, and app performance.

Having said that, we are a growing community of 300+ active individuals from a varied range of backgrounds, including hackers, developers, researchers, engineers, PhD students, professors, and many others. We organize a number of AMA sessions, talk shows, and live jam sessions for community interaction to assist people understand how easy it is to deploy to the edge and how anybody can try it out. Bringing awareness of edge computing to future seedlings.

  

## About Project

### Project Problem


EnvisEdge is an Apache 2.0 licensed library that allows users to simulate an edge computing environment to test their ideas and models before putting them in place on the edge. Although edge computing offers significant privacy and security benefits. It also demands a large amount of computing power on the hardware side. EnvisEdge allows researchers and data scientists to to experiment and test their hypotheses, and produce production-ready code without having direct access to the edge devices. Creating a path for global research and growth in the domains of computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

As previously said, we are a fast growing community. With the increase of contributor-driven modifications comes the need for improved and more accurate walkthroughs, tutorials, demos, and additional documentation updates. ([https://docs.nimbleedge.ai/](https://docs.nimbleedge.ai/) )

We'd like to join GSOD to expand our content base so that more researchers, developers, and data scientists may utilize EnvisEdge to bring their ideas to life. Providing them with the chance to advance in their respective fields now that running and testing their hypotheses is made easy. In the coming months, we also plan to release case studies and white papers along with research papers for conferences and public speaking events.

### Project Scope/Idea


For EnvisEdge, the technical writers will work on the following:

-   Create detailed content/ documentations for EnvisEdge users i.e, researchers, data scientists and developers to leverage the full potential of EnvisEdge in their study or research projects.
    
-   Creating high-level documentation for existing and future library features, such as Tutorials and How-Tos with solutions to frequently asked questions.
    
-   Populating the "Edge Computing Fundamentals" section by consolidating the information that is now strewn across the reference material.
    
-   Boost textual explanations with non-textual visuals or graphics. Our contributing design team will work with the writer to help them achieve their goals.
    
-   Refactoring information to current best practices and updating out-of-date references.
    
-   Compile a list of key advanced Edge Computing, Federated Learning, and recommender system principles and approaches.
    
-   Work with our contributing teams to create new documentation aimed at domain experts.
    
-   Improve existing readmes.
    
-   Create tutorials, demos, and theoretically explanatory articles for people with no prior experience with edge computing or other technology used in EnvisEdge.
    
-   Tutorial projects should allow users to learn by doing, and are up to date to ensure it works!
    
-   Write case studies, white paper and research paper content.
    
### Work that is out-of-scope for this project:

-   This project will only rewrite or alter current documentation or readme information, not the blog content. New blogs or articles must be authored from scratch.
    
-   This is not a content strategy project; instead, it will focus on providing user-friendly material to assist people in getting started with EnvisEdge and getting the most out of it. However, if the technical writer is interested, it is OK for him or her to come up with new blog or article topics in addition to those provided.
    
-   The writer does not need to have in-depth mathematical and conceptual knowledge of our code base (e.g. mathematical ideas employed, research focused expertise), but they must have a fundamental understanding of the subject and technical writing abilities.
    
We presume that the technical writer assigned to this project has no prior knowledge of NimbleEdge or its community. This means time will need to be built into the project plan at the start to get familiar with it. Mentors will provide walkthroughs, set up time for discussing with or interviewing different kinds of end-users and content experts. We are open to listening to writers' suggestions and contributions.

  
  

**TECHNICAL WRITERS:** Please email at community@nimbleedge.ai if you're interested in working on this project. Please also refer to the Google Season of Docs [Technical writer guide](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide) to prepare your statement of interest.

Please send your statement of interest by April 26th.

  

###  Project Success Measure



We'll consider the project a success if our contributors and users can easily get started with EnvisEdge and utilise it for their projects. Most of our pull requests (>60%) are from our existing contributors, it would be a good sign if more new contributors can start sending PRs. As for the article or blog content we will track the page views, visit duration, and bounce rate monthly after the renewed documentation and blog contents are published. We will also track the number of usersâ€™ getting started questions.

  
  

**We would consider the project successful if :**

-   The tutorials page views rises to 30%
    
-   The visit duration on tutorials rises to 30% (>1 minutes)
    
-   The bounce rate of tutorials decreases by 30% (<50%)
    
-   Fewer getting started questions. (<50%)
    
-   Increase in new contributor pull requests by 20%.
    
-   The number of contributors who have made >3 contributions increases by 10%.
    

  
  

### Timeline

The project itself will take approximately five months to complete. Once the tech writer is hired, we'll spend a half a month on technical writers orientation, then move onto the readme and documentation rewrites, followed by conceptual content for the blog, and spend the last few months focusing on creating the documentation, tutorials, demos, case studies, whitepapers and research papers.
